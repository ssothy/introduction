    <h1>What I Know</h1>
    <div class = "secondary">
        I feel like I've been practicing web design ever since middle school from the Myspace days. 
        I even kept taking web design classes in high school and I just can't remember a time when
        I wasn't making websites. Taking web design at NOVA basically reinforced what I knew, gave 
        me more confidence with css, and taught me how to make a sectioned website without using tables 
        because I remember that's the only way I knew how to do it in high school. I think my biggest
        strength is my eye for aesthetics. I've always had an eye for sleek looks with a usage of harmonious
        color themes. My weakness is that I think I'm pretty lazy or that I haven't fully integrated html 
        knowledge in my brain. I rely on w3schools too much I think.
