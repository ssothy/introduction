    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <div class="main">
        Hi there, my name is Samantha Sothy, but you can call me Sami.
        <br>
        I'm a military brat so I've had to live in a lot of different places, because of this 
        I really like to travel and adventure. I like to do anything outdoorsy like camping 
        , trying to climb anything that looks climbable, and swimming. When I'm indoors I find 
        joy in watching cat videos, doing artsy stuff, and playing video games. Currently my 
        favorite video game that I've been playing is Animal Crossing New Horizons because I can 
        live out my fantasy of living on an island with cute animal neighbors surrounded by fruit 
        trees. 
        <br>
        If you play come visit my island with my dream address! It's 2464-0657-2369.
