    <h1>What I've Done</h1>
    <div class = "secondary">
        I made a pretty cool basic website about boxing for ITD 110. This website is probably
        about to be my next brag even though it's kind of basic. Oh I also made another website 
        about horror movie reviews. That one was a cool project because I used my art skills to
        make a gif and a really nice header image. It was all spooky themed. I got range with my
        aesthetic abilities. As for tools I used to use Dreamweaver a lot. After last semester
        I'm finding myself attached to visual studio code right now. Also I would be so lost 
        without w3schools.
