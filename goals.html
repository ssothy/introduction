        I know this isn't probably about art but I'd like to be more confident with adding more
        different types of graphics to my websites. I like my minimalism though but I just don't know
        if it makes anyone feel anything. I feel like my html skills could use some more improvement.
        I just feel like I could be doing more sometimes. There's also probably a lot I still don't know
        when it comes to designing a nice website, but I'm excited to learn more.
